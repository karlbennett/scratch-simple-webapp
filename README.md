scratch-simple-webapp
==============

This is a demonstration of a web application that is built and tested with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/),
[Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/),
[Jasmin](http://jasmine.github.io/), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). It is completely self contained, so as long
as you have [Java](http://openjdk.java.net/) and Maven installed it should checkout, build, and run.
